## Introduction

We are a team of three - Ankit Peshin, Sarang Gupta, and Ankita Agrawal. We present here our exploratory data analysis, visualizations, interactive plots, animations and lots of other interesting insights into the Airbnb data. We focus on New York City’s data, for the very reason that we live in New York and second, we wish to perform an in-depth analysis on one of the most densely populated cities in the world.

###Following are a few questions that we aim to answer through our analysis:

* How do prices of listings vary by location?
* How does the demand for Airbnb rentals fluctuate across the year and over years?
* Are the demand and prices of the rentals correlated?
* What are the different types of properties in NYC? Do they vary by neighborhood?
* What localities in NYC are rated highly by guests?
* What makes a host Super host?
* Do regular hosts and super hosts have different cancellation and booking policies?
* Are there any common themes that can be identified from the free-text section of the reviews? What aspects of the rental experience do people like and what aspects do they abhor?

**The project is available on Github**:[`https://github.com/Ankit-Peshin/airbnb.git`](https://github.com/Ankit-Peshin/airbnb.git){target="_blank"}

### Contributions

All of us had a deep sense of teamwork and communicated well with each other. We were successful in acknowledging and appreciating each other's efforts while at the same time corrected each other along the way. As a team, we invested a lot of time in discussing and brainstorming ideas - from selecting the dataset to compiling the final version of this report.

The work was divided such that each of us worked on equally difficult and challenging tasks. To highlight a few contributions, Ankita worked on word cloud to derive meaning from customer reviews, led the development of the listings locator and along with Sarang was instrumental in giving a general structure to our analysis, making sense from the chaos. Ankit introduced word embeddings to analyze review data, and worked on the Shiny app to filter listings and another one to build a wordcloud of similar terms. Sarang produced a cool animation showing the rise in the number of Airbnb rentals in NYC over the years, and performed some interesting time-series investigation.

Static visualizations were also distributed such that each one of us gets to work with the entire data set and thus be able to help with issues faced by other team members and accelerate productivity. It was a highly collaborative effort where our work went through a review process and Github's version control was convenient.

## Description of Data

The data is sourced from the **Inside Airbnb** website `http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html` which hosts publicly available data from the Airbnb site.

The dataset comprises of three main tables:

* `listings` - Detailed listings data showing 96 atttributes for each of the listings. Some of the attributes used in the analysis are `price` (continuous), `longitude` (continuous), `latitude` (continuous), `listing_type` (categorical), `is_superhost` (categorical), `neighbourhood` (categorical), `ratings` (continuous) among others.

* `reviews` - Detailed reviews given by the guests with 6 attributes. Key attributes include `date` (datetime), `listing_id` (discrete), `reviewer_id` (discrete) and `comment` (textual).

* `calendar` - Provides details about booking for the next year by listing. Four attributes in total including `listing_id` (discrete), `date` (datetime), `available` (categorical) and `price` (continuous).

A quick glance at the data shows that there are:

* 50,968 unique listing in NYC in total. The first rental in NYC was up in April, 2008 in Harlem, Manhattan.
* Over 1 million reviews have been written by guests since then.
* The price for a listing ranges from $10 per night to $10,000(!) per night. Listing with $10,000 price tag are in Greenpoint, Brooklyn; Astoria, Queens and Upper West Side, Manhattan.

## Analysis of Data Quality

We had to perform a few imputations and transformations on our dataset for us to create the desired visualizations. There were no major inconsistencies or mismatches in the data, but most of the columns/features we were interested in did not contain data in the required format and hence were manipulated in a way that their meanings are retained. 

### A brief analysis of some features:

#### Key Feature Engineering

1. ```comment (reviews)```: We extensively used this feature in our analysis. The dataset contained reviews in multiple languages such as Chinese, Spanish, and English which made it difficult for it to be analyzed. We subsetted the data to include only the reviews that were in English and performed text filtering to remove common stop words and phrases that do not significantly contribute to the meaning of the review.

2.``` price (listings, calendar)```: The price column contained data in string format with the currency symbol ‘$’ and comma separator ‘,’ attached to it. This column was manipulated to contain integer values for time-series and other analysis.

3. ```date (calendar, listings, reviews)```: The date was contained in mm-dd-yyyy format. It was transformed multiple times during the analysis to obtain weekly, monthly or yearly insights.

4): ```rating (listings)```: There are several ratings that hosts receive including ‘location rating’, ‘cleanliness rating’ and ‘overall rating’. Values in these columns comprised of percentages, integers, and char string. Data were standardized and transformed to a similar scale.

#### Sampling Data
The ```comments``` feature in the ```reviews``` datasets constituted of more than 1 million values. To conduct a textual analysis on the review, it had to be split into a bag of words which would contain more than 20 million words. Due to computational limitation, we randomly sampled the ‘reviews’ dataset to contain 30% of the original observations.


#### Dealing with Missing Values
The data also had null values. To preserve all the information, we imputed or dropped the rows and columns containing null values while conducting exploratory analysis that made use of these features.

We construct a ```visna``` plot to analyze the missing values for the variables that we would be using in our exploratory analysis.


```{r fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
listingdf1 <- read.csv('data/listings.csv')
missingdata<-listingdf1
missingdata[missingdata == ""] <- NA
missingdata <- missingdata %>% select(host_is_superhost,neighbourhood_group_cleansed,review_scores_rating,host_response_time,name,host_since,zipcode)

missingdata <- missingdata %>% rename(!!"Host is superhost" := host_is_superhost,!!"Neighbourhood" := neighbourhood_group_cleansed,!!"Response time" := host_response_time,!!"Listing Name" := name,!!"Host since" := host_since, !!"Zipcode" := zipcode,!!"Review scores rating" := review_scores_rating)

visna(missingdata,sort="c", mar.col = c("#e06f69","#357b8a"))
```

Few observations from the plot:

* Most of the rows have no missing values. 
* ```review_scores_rating``` variable is missing from almost 30% of the rows. 
* ```zipcode``` , ```listing_name``, ```host_response_time```, ```host_since```, and  ```host_is_super_host``` have missing values in few rows and hence they are not reflected in the bar graph on the right.

We can conclude from the above plot that the Airbnb dataset contains only a few NA values which further helps us argue that the analysis done on this data is performed without much loss of information.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we will detail our analysis to the questions of interest mentioned in the introduction and gain preliminary insights through exploratory data analysis and visualization. We have divided it into four subsections that aim to answer the questions through a variety of different visualization.

* **Spatial Data Analysis**
* **Demand and Price Analysis**
* **User Review (Textual Data) Mining**
* **Other Interesting Insights**

###Spatial Data Analysis

This section will explore various variables from our dataset using spatial visualizations and will answer  questions relating to variations in prices and ratings across different locations in NYC.

```{r Spatial Data 1.1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Reading Listings Data
listingdf <- read.csv('data/listings.csv')

#Creating Listings across NYC
leaflet(listingdf) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude,labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = F),clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(),popup = paste0("<b> Name: </b>", listingdf$name , "<br/><b> Host Name: </b>", listingdf$host_name, "<br> <b> Price: </b>", listingdf$price, "<br/><b> Room Type: </b>", listingdf$room_type, "<br/><b> Property Type: </b>", listingdf$property_type
                 )) %>% 
  setView(-74.00, 40.71, zoom = 12) %>%
  addProviderTiles("CartoDB.Positron")

```

This is the basic interactive graph with all the listing in New York City appearing in a clustered fashion. You can click on clusters to see the listing it comprises. This gives a zoom-in view. You can further click on each listing to see details like Listing Name, Host Name, Price of the property, Property Type, Room Type. This visualization helps to explore every listing geographically. It gives the overall sense of how the listings are distributed across neighborhood. We can see from the map that maximum listing are clustered around Manhattan and Brooklyn region, followed by Queens, Bronx and the least number of listing are in Staten Island.

Airbnb users (customers) rate their stay on the basis of location, cleanliness and a host of other parameters. Here we work with the location score data. It would be interesting to see the average location scores for each neighbourhood. The location scores have to be a firm indicator of the appeal of the neighbourhood. Highly rated neighbourhoods will tend to have better connectivity (subway stations), will tend to be closer to the city hotspots (Times Square, Emire State, Wall Street).

```{r Spatial Data 1.2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Which locations have better ratings?
zipReviews <- listings %>% group_by(zipcode = zipcode) %>% summarise(avg_loc_review = mean(review_scores_location, na.rm = TRUE))
colnames(zipReviews) <- c("region","value")
zipReviews$region <- as.character(zipReviews$region)
nyc_fips = c(36005, 36047, 36061, 36081, 36085)

g_locations <- zip_choropleth(zipReviews,
county_zoom = nyc_fips,
title = "Location Review Scores by Region",
legend = "Average Score") + ggtitle("Which area is the best?",
          subtitle = "Map showing Average Location Score by Area") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))+scale_color_gradient(low="#d3cbcb", high="#852eaa")+ scale_fill_brewer("Location Review Score",palette=3)

g_locations

```

The graph confirms our theory and some more. Manhattan receives the highest location scores for the downtown region (esp below Central Park). In Staten Island, the areas close to the State Park have the highest location scores. Brooklyn neighbourhoods close to Manhattan tend to have higher location ratings. Looking at the NY subway system in Brooklyn, it is interesting to observe that the highly rated areas correspond with subway line presence. The same is true for Bronx where subway lines do not go.


```{r Spatial Data 1.3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Which area is more expensive?
listings$price <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", substring(listings$price, 2)))
zipPrices <- listings %>% group_by(zipcode = zipcode) %>% summarise(avg_price = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE))

colnames(zipPrices) <- c("region","value")
zipPrices$region <- as.character(zipPrices$region)
nyc_fips = c(36005, 36047, 36061, 36081, 36085)

g_price_location <- zip_choropleth(zipPrices,
county_zoom = nyc_fips,
title = "Average Price by Region",
legend = "Average Score") + ggtitle("Which area is expensive?",
          subtitle = "Map showing Average Price by Area") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))+scale_color_gradient(low="#d3cbcb", high="#852eaa")+ scale_fill_brewer("Average Price",palette=4)

g_price_location

```

This map follows from our previous location ratings by neighbourhood map. Now it is obvious that the highly rated location would also tend to be costly (demand vs supply). This graph would be a good opportunity to put our previous results to test. 

Again downtown Manhattan is the clear winner when it comes to high rents, as is true for the neighbourhoods of Brooklyn close to Manhattan. The East Village area in Downtown Manhattan is a clear outlier, where both rents and location scores tend to be lower than its surrounding regions. It would be interesting to conduct 2 studies - 
i). *Find high rating - low rent regions (best of both worlds)* : The State Park region in Staten Island (discussed in the previous graph) is one such region where rents tend to be fairly low despite having the highest location rating. Another such sweet-spot lies to the North East of Brooklyn.
ii). *Find low rating - high rent regions (worst of both worlds)* : The Elm Park region of Staten Island has disproportionately high rents, yet very low location scores. Other such locations can be found towards the Northern Bronx regions.

Through visualization, we wish to study the relationship between property type and neighbourhood. The primary question we aim to answer is whether different boroughs constitute of different rental types. Though there are more than 20 types, we will be focussing on the top 5 by their total count in the city and understanding their distribution in each borough. 

```{r Spatial Data 1.4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

propertydf <-  listingdf %>% group_by(neighbourhood_group_cleansed, property_type) %>% summarize(Freq = n())
propertydf <- propertydf %>% filter(property_type %in% c("Apartment","House","Condominium","Townhouse", "Loft"))

totalproperty<-  listingdf %>% filter(property_type %in% c("Apartment","House","Condominium","Townhouse", "Loft"))%>% group_by(neighbourhood_group_cleansed) %>% summarize(sum = n())

propertyratio <- merge(propertydf, totalproperty, by="neighbourhood_group_cleansed")
propertyratio <- propertyratio %>% mutate(ratio = Freq/sum)

ggplot(propertyratio, aes(x=neighbourhood_group_cleansed, y=ratio, fill = property_type)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge",stat="identity") + xlab("Borough") + ylab("Count")+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Property Type") + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  ggtitle("Which types of Listings are there in NYC?",
          subtitle = "Map showing Count of Listing Type by Borough ") +
          theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
          theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
          theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))+scale_color_gradient(low="#d3cbcb", high="#852eaa")+
          scale_fill_manual("Property Type", values=c("#e06f69","#357b8a", "#7db5b8", "#59c6f3", "#f6c458")) +
          xlab("Neighborhood") + ylab("Percentage")

```

The plot shows the ratio of property type and the total number of properties in the borough.

#### Some key observations from the graph are 

1. We can see that Apartment style listings are highest in number in all four neighborhoods except Staten Island. Staten Island has more 'House' style property than 'Apartments'. This analysis seems intuitive, as we know that Staten Island is not that densely populated and has a lot of space.   

2. The maximum apartment style listings are located in Manhattan, constituting 90% of all properties in that neighborhood. Next is Brooklyn with 75% Apartment style listing followed by Queens with 60% apartment style.

3. Queens and Bronx also have a lot of House style listings. Queens constitute 25% House style properties, which is greatest after Staten Islands.

4. Loft style properties are also common in New York. Brooklyn constitutes of 10% of Loft style listing followed by Manhattan with nearly 7% loft style.

5. Staten Island has nearly 10% of Town House listings, as we know that States Island is widely spread. Townhouses are also common in Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens with nearly 5-7% townhouse style properties listed.

6. Condominium styles are most common in the Bronx constituting nearly 5% of its listings.

### Demand and Price Analysis

In this section, we will analyse the demand for Airbnb listings in New York City. We will look at  demand over the years since the inception of Airbnb in 2009 and across months of the year to understand seasonlity. We also wish to establish a relation between price and demand. The question we aspire to answer is whether prices of listings fluctuate with demand. We will also conduct a more granular analysis to understand how prices vary by days of the week.

To study the demand, since we did not have data on the bookings made over the past year, we will use 'number of reviews' variable as the indicator for demand. As per Airbnb, about 50% of guests review the hosts/listings, hence studying the number of review will give us a good estimation of the demand.

#### How popular has Airbnb become in New York City?

```{r Demand/Price Analysis 2.1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

reviewsNum <- reviews %>% group_by(date = reviews$date) %>% summarise(number = n())

ggplot(reviewsNum, aes(date, number)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, color = "#007A87", alpha=0.5) +geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+
  ggtitle("How popular is Airbnb?",
          subtitle = "Number of Reviews across years") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Unique listings recieving reviews") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

```

1.The number of unique listings receiving reviews has increased over the years. We can see an almost exponential increase in the number of reviews, which as discussed earlier, indicates an exponential increase in the demand.

2.One can observe that number of reviews/demand also depicts a seasonal pattern. Every year there are peaks and drop in the demand, indicating that certain months are busier compared to the others. 

Let us look at monthly demands for each of the years starting from 2014.

```{r Demand/Price Analysis 2.2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(reviewsNum[year(reviewsNum$date) == 2016,], aes(date, number)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, color = "#007A87", alpha=0.5) +geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+
  ggtitle("Seasonality in Demand",
          subtitle = "Number of Reviews across Months in 2016") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Unique listings recieving reviews") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

ggplot(reviewsNum[year(reviewsNum$date) == 2017,], aes(date, number)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, color = "#007A87", alpha=0.5) +geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+
  ggtitle("Seasonality in Demand",
          subtitle = "Number of Reviews across Months in 2017") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Unique listings recieving reviews") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

demand2018 <- ggplot(reviewsNum[year(reviewsNum$date) == 2018,], aes(date, number)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, color = "#007A87", alpha=0.5) +geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+
  ggtitle("Seasonality in Demand",
          subtitle = "Number of Reviews across Months in 2018") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Unique listings recieving reviews") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

demand2018

```

The dots in the above graph reflect the number of reviews written on a particular date, which as per our assumption reflects the demand. There seems to be a consistent pattern in how demand fluctuates across the year, which is reflected in each of the graphs shown above. The demand is lowest in January and increases until October, when it begins to falls until the end of the year.

We inferred that this could possibly be due to the holiday season kicking in, with people celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas at home with their family, leading to a slump in tourism and hence the demand for tourist lodging. To confirm our findings, we surveyed the data from the **National Tourism and Travel Office (NTTO)** website and observed a similar pattern in number of non-resident arrivals to the US (NYC as the port of entry) across the year. The number of arrivals were the lowest lowest in January, increasing until October and the beginning to decline from November until the end of the year (unfortunately we could not find statistics on the domestic arrivals to NYC). 

The data can be accessed through the below link: [`https://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2017-I-001/index.asp`](https://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2017-I-001/index.asp){target="_blank"}



#### How is Airbnb priced across the year?

After observing the pattern in the demand, we wanted to investigate whether the prices of the listings follow a similar pattern. To answer the above question, we looked at the daily average prices of the listings acoss the years using the data from the `calendar` table. 



```{r Demand/Price Analysis 2.3, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

calendar2016 <- read_csv("data/calendar2016.csv")
calendar2017 <- read_csv("data/calendar2017.csv")
calendar2018 <- read_csv("data/calendar.csv")

combinedCalendar <- rbind(calendar2016, calendar2017, calendar2018)
combinedCalendar$price <- as.numeric(gsub(",", "", substring(combinedCalendar$price, 2)))

groupedCalendarAll <- combinedCalendar %>% group_by(date = date) %>% summarise(averagePrice = mean(price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% mutate(year = year(date), commonYear = paste("2016",substring(date, 6),sep="-"))

groupedCalendarAll$year <- as.factor(as.character(groupedCalendarAll$year))
groupedCalendarAll$commonYear <- ymd(groupedCalendarAll$commonYear)

ggplot(groupedCalendarAll[year(groupedCalendarAll$date) >= 2017 & year(groupedCalendarAll$date) < 2019,], aes(commonYear, averagePrice)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, alpha=0.5, color = "#007A87") + geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+ facet_grid(~year)+
  ggtitle("Seasonality in Price",
          subtitle = "Average listing price across Months") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Average price across Listings") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68")) + scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%b"))

```

The average prices across listings tends to increase as one progresses along the year and spikes in December. The pattern is similar to that of the number of reviews/demand except in the months of November and December, where the number of reviews (indicative of demand) starts to fall. This seems counter-intuitive as one would expect the price to decrease with a decrease in demand. This could possibly due to the assumption that we made that number of reviews is a reflection of the demand, which might not always be the case.

We can also see two sets of points on the above charts which depicts that average prices on certain days were higher compared to the other days. Following, we will plot a box plot of average prices by day of the week to understand this phenomenon.


```{r Demand/Price Analysis 2.4, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

groupedCalendarAll <- groupedCalendarAll %>% mutate(day = strftime(date,'%A'))
groupedCalendarAll$day <- factor(groupedCalendarAll$day, levels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"), labels=c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

ggplot(groupedCalendarAll, aes(x = factor(day), 
                     y = averagePrice)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#FF5A5F", color = "#565A5C") + 
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05, width = 0.1, color = "#007A87") +
  ggtitle("Is it expensive to travel on weekends?",
          subtitle = "Boxplots of Price by Day of the Week") +
  labs(x = "Day of the week", y = "Average Price") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

```

As we can see, Fridays and Saturdays are more expensive compared to the other days of the weeks, perhaps due to higher demand for lodging.

#### Occupancy Rate by Month 

We will end the analysis of the section by studying how the occupancy looks like for the next year. Using the table `calendar`, we will find out the precentage occupancy for the next year i.e. as of November 3, 2018 (the date when the data was collected), what percentage of appartments have already been booked. We could not obtain the past data on the occupancy, hence were not able to study what the actual occupancy rates look like.

We believe looking at the occupancy for the next year will also give us good estimation of the seasonal demand.


```{r Demand/Price Analysis 2.5, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

calendar <- calendar %>% mutate(booked = ifelse(available=="f", 1, 0))
groupedCalendar <- calendar %>% group_by(date = date) %>% summarise(totalBooked = sum(booked, na.rm = TRUE), totalListings = n()) %>% mutate(percent_booked = (totalBooked/totalListings)*100)

calendarHeat(groupedCalendar$date, groupedCalendar$percent_booked, ncolors = 99, color = "g2r", varname="Occupancy (Percentage) by Month")

```

From the above calendar heatmap for 2018 - 2019, we can infer that January tends to be the quietest, and the occupancy rate increases as we progress through the year. This ties up with our results from our analysis of the number of reviews (indicative of the demand) which shows an increasing trend across the year.

###User Review (Textual Data) Mining

The dataset provides us with a ton of data, but nothing as insightful and close to the customer as their reviews/feedback. If mined properly, they can tell us a lot about the customer mindset, their expectations and how well those were met. For the final result to make sense, the review text data requires a lot of cleaning - eg. the words need to be stemmed, commas-fullstops-percentages etc need to be removed, common English words and stop words need to be removed etc.

```{r wordcloud 3.1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sampledreviews <- read_csv('data/sampledreviews.csv')

splitsampledreviewscoloumn <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(sampledreviews$reviews), split=" "))
reviewsWordDF <- data.frame("word" = splitsampledreviewscoloumn)

wordDF <- reviewsWordDF %>% count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()

library("tm")
docs <- Corpus(VectorSource(splitsampledreviewscoloumn)) 
docs <- tm_map(docs, content_transformer(tolower))
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, stopwords("english"))
docs = tm_map(docs,removePunctuation)
docs <- tm_map(docs, removeWords, c("we","it", "he", "this", "i", "the", "apartment","de", "un","us","well","es","5","la","2",""))

newcorpusdf <- data.frame(text=sapply(docs, identity), 
    stringsAsFactors=F)
newcorpusdffiltered <- newcorpusdf %>% filter(text != "")
wordDF <- newcorpusdffiltered %>% count(text, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup()

library(RColorBrewer)
library(wordcloud)

####Comment Analysis Using Word Cloud

Let us start first with looking at the dominant themes in the reviews; simply building a word cloud should solve this purpose. Wordclouds take a frequency count of the words in the corpus as input, and return a beautiful display of dominant (frequently occurring) words, with their size being proportional to their relative frequency. We have more than a million reviews, so we need to take a random sample of this data, in this case ~30k reviews. While the sampled dataset size may seem very small in comparison to the original, it serves our purpose well because we only need the generic words here. Future analysis on "positive" and "negative" reviews needs more data as we'll see in the next section.

An analysis of the word cloud shows interesting trends; Location seems to be key, since the words "neighbourhood", "location", "area" are featured prominently in the word cloud. Transport options like "subway", "walk" also find frequent mention. Airbnbs are short term rentals, yet people seem to lay stress on the comfort aspect of their stay, words like "kitchen" tell us that many folks would rather cook than eat out. Availability of "Restaurants" close by find mention too. Bathrooms and Beds, as expected can be clear deal breakers if not in top condition. The word "Host" finds a lot of mention; indicating the important role that hosts play in shaping the Airbnb experience. 

```{r Review Analysis 3.2 Word Vector, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

tokens <- space_tokenizer(as.character(reviews$comments))
it = itoken(tokens, progressbar = FALSE)
vocab <- create_vocabulary(it)
vectorizer <- vocab_vectorizer(vocab)
# use window of 5 for context words
tcm <- create_tcm(it, vectorizer, skip_grams_window = 5L)
glove = GlobalVectors$new(word_vectors_size = 50, vocabulary = vocab, x_max = 10)
glove = GlobalVectors$new(word_vectors_size = 50, vocabulary = vocab, x_max = 10)
# `glove` object will be modified by `fit()` call !
word_vectors = glove$fit_transform(tcm, n_iter = 20)
word_vectors1 <- glove$components
```

####Building Word Vectors from Reviews

The word cloud generated previously does a good job of finding what customers are looking for, but it is very generic. Wouldn't it be great if we could find what people think of the room sizes? How about seeing what makes customers "uncomfortable"?

Well, not to worry; word vectors come to the rescue. Word vectors simply place any given word in an n-dimensional space; and the proximity of any two words in this vector space is proportional to their "similarity". We use the review data to construct such a vector space to build a word cloud of similar words, derive interesting insights. The first word cloud is for the word "uncomfortable". Words similar to "uncomfortable" are usually those that occur in conjunction with it frequently, i.e reasons for the discomfort. The word cloud shows just that - notice words like "cramped", "crowded","small", "stuffy" and 
"cluttered" indicating that lack of space is one of the most common complaints. "Hot", "damp" and "cold" are some of the common temperature issues. "Dusty", "dirty" and "unclean" surroundings will prompt people to write negative feedback. Many feel "nervous","unsafe" and "stressful"; clearly a red flag for future tenants. So, as you can see, word vectors add so much more meaning to our analysis.

Similarly, querying by the keyword "comfortable", we hope to see things that led to a positive experience. Prominently featured are words like "quiet", "walkable", "clean", "spotless", etc, again demonstrating the importance of environment, location and cleanliness. Helpful "hosts" and "communication" lead to a comfortable. Cleanliness of linens and the bed size leave an decisive impression.

```

####RShiny WordCloud Generator by Query String

Now that we have seen how insightful word vectors can be, it would make sense to develop a tool that allows you to query any word and generate its corresponding word cloud. Words like "happy"-"sad" can again show us the things that matter most to people. However, more specific queries can also give us a wealth of insights. Querying by the term "amenities" shows some of the popular amenities that people seek (and talk about) : "towels", "linens", "kitchenware", "wifi", "groceries" (i.e nearby shops for groceries). "Breakfast"" seems to be the most prominently featured meal.

We'll leave you to further explore the wordcloud!

###Other Interesting Insights

In this section we will explore and analyze various features which were not analyzed in other sections. We will answer the following questions in this section:

*What makes someone a superhost?
*Are there any insights about the hosts preferences that can be obtained from  missing or empty data?
*What insights to other categorical variables in the dataset provide?

####What makes someone a superhost?

Airbnb awards the title of "Superhost" to a small fraction of its dependable hosts. This is designed as an incentive program that is a win-win for both the host, Airbnb, and their customers. The superhost gets more business in the form of higher bookings, the customer gets improved service and Airbnb gets happy satisfied customers.


```{r 4.1 Superhost, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

listings1 <- listings
num_reviews <- reviews %>% group_by(listing_id)%>% summarise(sum1 = n())
listings1$host_response_rate = as.integer(gsub("%","",listings1$host_response_rate))
listings1$review_scores_rating = as.integer(gsub("%","",listings1$review_scores_rating))
#list1 = listings[!is.na(listings$host_response_rate) & is.na(listings$review_scores_rating),]
l1 = listings1[!is.na(listings1$review_scores_rating),]
l1 = l1[!is.na(l1$host_is_superhost),]
l1 = l1[l1$host_is_superhost!='',]
l1$host_is_superhost[l1$host_is_superhost == "t"] <- "True"
l1$host_is_superhost[l1$host_is_superhost == "f"] <- "False"
l1$host_is_superhost <- factor(l1$host_is_superhost)

colnames(num_reviews) = c("id","sum")
l1 = merge(l1, num_reviews, by = "id")
colnames(l1)[which(names(l1) == "host_is_superhost")] <- "Superhost"
superhost = ggplot(l1,aes(host_response_rate,review_scores_rating,color=Superhost))+geom_point(alpha = .5,stroke=0) +xlab("Host Response Rate") +ylab("Avg Ratings")+ ggtitle("What does it take to be a Super Host")

superhost + ggtitle("What does it take to be a Superhost?",
          subtitle = "Average Rating by Response Rate") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

```

But what does it take to be a Superhost? Airbnb's site has a set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order to become one. Maintaining a review rate above 50%, a response rate above 90%, etc. Here we investigate our dataset to see how the superhosts perform on two parameters : "Response rate" and "Ratings". Both these variables range from 0 to 100. 

The scatter plot gives a few interesting insights. While most super-hosts are in the high-rating:high-response-rate region, we can also see a few hosts with response rates less than 75% (which violates the 90%+ critera set by Airbnb). This is a very small fraction of the hosts. In terms of Ratings, almost all hosts are rated 80% and above. 

With that being said, most Airbnb hosts lie in the high-rating:high-response region, but only a small fraction get to be super hosts. So clearly, becoming a Superhost  takes a lot more than high ratings & response rates.


####Analyis of Categorical Variables:

In this section, we will analyze the relationship between the different categorical variables in our dataset. The variables that we will be examining are ```instant_booking```, ```cancellation_policy```, and ```room_type```. We believe these features are of great importance to both customers and owners at the time of reservation.

Our goal is to understand owners’ behavior with respect to these policies and examine if there is any correlation existing among the variables. We will also study if regular hosts and super hosts have different policies with regards to instant booking and cancellation.


```{r fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
library(alluvial)
library(readr)
listingdf1 <- read_csv('data/listings.csv')
filteredColumns <- listingdf1 %>% select(instant_bookable,cancellation_policy, room_type,host_is_superhost)
filteredColumns <- filteredColumns %>% filter(filteredColumns$host_is_superhost != "")
filteredColumnsByFreq <-  filteredColumns %>% group_by(instant_bookable,cancellation_policy,room_type,host_is_superhost) %>% summarize(Freq = n())
filteredColumnsByFreq[filteredColumnsByFreq=='f']<- "False"
filteredColumnsByFreq[filteredColumnsByFreq=='t']<- "True"
filteredColumnsByFreq[filteredColumnsByFreq=='strict_14_with_grace_period']<- "Strict With Grace Period"
filteredColumnsByFreq[filteredColumnsByFreq=='flexible']<- "Flexible"
filteredColumnsByFreq[filteredColumnsByFreq=='moderate']<- "Moderate"
filteredColumnsByFreq <- filteredColumnsByFreq %>% filter(Freq > 100)

h <- 0.12
layout(matrix(1:2, 2, 1), heights=c( h, 1-h ) )
op <- par(mar=rep(0,4))
plot(0:1, type="n", axes=FALSE, ann=FALSE)
legend("center", pch=15, 
       bty="n",
       ncol=2,
       pt.cex=2,
       plot=TRUE,
       col=c("#8ccacc","#e06e69"),
       legend=c( "Host","Super Host"),
       title="Type of Host")
par(op)
alluvial( filteredColumnsByFreq[,1:3], freq=filteredColumnsByFreq$Freq, alpha=0.8,cw=0.14,gap.width=0.05, col=ifelse( filteredColumnsByFreq$host_is_superhost == "True", "#e06e69", "#8ccacc"),border="NA",axis_labels=c("Instant Booking","Cancellation Policy","Room Type"))

```

#####Below are the key takeaways from the above chart:

1. One can observe that the majority of the listings are not available for Instant Bookings. Majority of the ones that are available tend to have a strict cancellation policy.

2. Properties that are entire homes or apartments tend to have a stricter cancellation policy compared to private and shared rooms. Intuitively this makes sense as the hosts would want to prevent incurring a huge loss by last-minute cancellations on an entire home/apartment style property booking.

3. As the no. of listing for a shared room is very less, we can observe a very thin line on the graph. From the graph, all these lines suggest that the shared room are available for instant booking and have a flexible cancellation policy. This is intuitive, as shared spaces bookings are usually on a need basis, and are often last minute and thus this inference supports our intuition. 

4. We can observe that owners of shared room spaces are generally regular hosts. 

5. Lastly, it can also be observed that there are no unique patterns observed between super host and regular host and they seem to display a similar behavior for the features we are inspecting here.

###Executive Summary

The Airbnb dataset provides us with a fantastic source to better understand New York's bustling rental landscape. With over 50k listings registered in the last 9 years, New York has proven to be one of Airbnb's fastest growing cities. Between 2010 and 2014, as more and more people adopted the use of the internet as a service provider, the number of listings doubled every year. A prediction of 70k listings by 2020 shoudn't be very far off. Downtown Manhattan and the adjacent parts of Brooklyn had by far the highest concentration of listings. Staten Island and Bronx have been slow adopters. This animation we developed does a good job of visualizing Airbnb's host network growth.

#####Demand and Supply : Airbnb Customer Growth vs Listing Prices over time

While there is an overall increasing trend for both customer numbers and listing prices, some very interesting seasonal patterns present themselves. The number of customer reviews written at a given timestamp are a good indicator of the demand around that time. As the adopters of Airbnb increase, one would expect the number of reviews to also increase through Jan to Dec every year, however we notice an interesting trend. The number of reviews tend to peak around October every year and there is a marked drop towards the year end. The Holidays seem to be a reasonable explanation for this decline. Listing prices on the other hand increase from January through April where they plateau until November. The year end sees a sudden uptick in prices of around 12% by New Year. This gain is negated within a few days into January.

Talking about weekly trends, the prices remain fairly constant through the week days but tend increase around the weekend.

```{r fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }

price2018 <- ggplot(groupedCalendarAll[year(groupedCalendarAll$date) == 2018,], aes(commonYear, averagePrice)) +
           geom_point(na.rm=TRUE, alpha=0.5, color = "#007A87") + geom_smooth(color = "#FF5A5F")+
  ggtitle("Seasonality in Price",
          subtitle = "Average listing price across Months in 2018") +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Average price across Listings") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68")) + scale_x_date(labels = date_format("%b"))


grid.arrange(demand2018, price2018, ncol=2)

```

#####Location, Location, Location! : Understanding New York's Real Estate scene  

They say there are three things that matter in property; Location, location and location. And we're here to say YES. Highly rated locations also tend to be the most expensive ones. Again downtown Manhattan and adjacent areas of Brooklyn receive the highest location scores, with East Village being an exception. A marked drop in location scores is seen as the subway lines end. 

The listing costs are largely in line with the location scores. It is however interesting to spot a few outliers :
i). *Find high rating - low rent regions (best of both worlds)* : The State Park region in Staten Island (discussed in the previous graph) is one such region where rents tend to be fairly low despite having the highest location rating. Another such sweet-spot lies to the North East of Brooklyn.
ii). *Find low rating - high rent regions (worst of both worlds)* : The Elm Park region of Staten Island has disproportionately high rents, yet very low location scores. Other such locations can be found towards the Northern Bronx regions.

```{r fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }
grid.arrange(g_locations, g_price_location, ncol=2)
```

#####Getting into the Customer's Head : Analyzing Customer Reviews

Understanding your customers is key to running a successful business. The customer reviews can provide a wealth of information if mined properly. Some dominant positive themes that made people "comfortable" were cleanliness, the neighbourhood and if certain places were "walkable". "Hosts" and "communication" feature prominently, and bed-sheets and linens leave a decisive impression if unclean. Similarly, a few themes weren't pleasurable for the guest are room size (described by "small","stuffy","claustrophobic"), temperature/heating issues ("cold","hot","damp") and safety issues ("nervous","unsafe","stressful"),

Our tool built in RShiny also allows us to query terms to find dominant associated themes. For instance, a search for "linens" returned descriptors such as “stained”, smelled” (negatives), and others such as “crisp”, “fluffy”, “spotless”, “new”, “comfy”, “fresh”, etc. (positives).

#####Hosts with Super Powers! : Analyzing what it takes to become a Superhost

Airbnb awards the title of “Superhost” to a small fraction of its dependable hosts. This is designed as an incentive program that is a win-win for both the host, Airbnb, and their customers. The superhost gets more business in the form of higher bookings, the customer gets improved service and Airbnb gets happy satisfied customers.

But what does it take to be a Superhost? Airbnb’s site has a set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order to become one. Maintaining a review rate above 50%, a response rate above 90%, etc. Our findings, while mostly in line with the Airbnb's guidelines, also show some interesting outliers.While most super-hosts are in the high-rating:high-response-rate region, we can also see a few hosts with response rates less than 75% (which violates the 90%+ critera set by Airbnb). This is a very small fraction of the hosts. In terms of Ratings, almost all hosts are rated 80% and above.

With that being said, most Airbnb hosts lie in the high-rating:high-response region, but only a small fraction get to be super hosts. So clearly, becoming a Superhost takes a lot more than high ratings & response rates.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE }

superhost + ggtitle("What does it take to be a Superhost?",
          subtitle = "Average Rating by Response Rate") +

  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey35")) +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = "grey68"))

###Interactive Components

Our work with static components so far has revealed many key insights about demand-supply, customer reviews, average costs and ratings across various New York neighborhoods, etc. Static components do a good job of conveying our findings to our readers.

This section however is all about giving the user the power to identify patterns through easy to use tools. 


####Airbnb Listing Locator 
Link to the animation
[`https://ankitpeshin.shinyapps.io/listings/`](https://ankitpeshin.shinyapps.io/listings/){target="_blank"}


Our first interactive component is a **Airbnb Listing Locator**, which displays all the listings on a map that satisfy the user requirements. Here are the parameters that the user can control and filter on:

1. ```Borough``` (Manhattan—default, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island) : User can select multiple boroughs 
2. ```Property type``` (32 categories, eg. Apartment-default, Loft, Townhouse, etc) : User can select multiple property types
3. ```Max daily budget``` ($0 to $300, default=$30) : User can select the desired price range 
4. ```Number of People``` (0 to 10, default=1) : Number of users seeking accommodation.
5. ```Minimum Rating``` (0 to 100, default=60%) : Will filter and show listings with equal to or higher rating than selected option.

Since the map has to present so many listing data points, we use a function to form “clusters” listing markers. Clicking on a cluster of Let us now go through some exploratory analysis. Say we want to see the number of high rated “apartments” that are available in the different neighborhoods of New York for under $20 a night. 

![Overview](./screenshots/file1.png)

The results are pretty self explanatory. Four listings in Uptown Manhattan, 20 - which is the most, in the Downtown Manhattan - Bronx region. No listings in Staten Island. 
One can similarly look for Guest Suites in Staten Island with no Budget and Rating constraints.

![Filter1](./screenshots/file2.png)

Clicking on a listing gives further details of the form : “name of listing”, “property type”, “price/night”, and “description”. This is a preliminary analysis; the visualization possibilities are endless.

####Airbnb Network Growth over the years (Animation)

Airbnb’s first New York listing was in Harlem in the year 2008, and the growth since has been exponential. This animation helps visualize Airbnb’s growth in New York over the years. Around 600 properties were added in the first couple years, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  Downtown Manhattan and close lying areas in Brooklyn have always had high Airbnb presence. The number of listings has roughly doubled each year since then. By the year 2015, every neighborhood of Manhattan had a multiple listings. Interestingly Bronx has very few listings, so few that the Manhattan-Bronx border can be seen in the animation by the sudden drop in listings. Since 2016, Airbnb listings have spread to parts of Staten Island. The animation also makes it easy to see the trend in listing counts; a prediction of 70k properties by 2020 shouldn’t be far off.

####Airbnb Word Cloud Generator

Link to the animation
[`https://ankitpeshin.shinyapps.io/wordcloud_generator/ `](https://ankitpeshin.shinyapps.io/wordcloud_generator/ ){target="_blank"}

This Shiny App serves as an extension to our previous Word-Vector analysis of the customer reviews.  Once the word vector has been built, anyone can query the vector to find “similar” words and build a word-cloud. User can enter any valid query word and set the “max words” in the word cloud. A valid query word would be one that is present in the corpus, else it wouldn’t be part of the word vector. It is easy to think of such words; for instance let us generate the word cloud for “linens”.


![wordcloud1](./screenshots/file4.png)

The WordCloud generator presents interesting insights. The obvious words like “toiletries”, “beddings”, ”towels”, etc. are part of the word cloud. However, descriptors such as “stained”, smelled” (negatives), and others such as “crisp”, “fluffy”, “spotless”, “new”, “comfy”, “fresh”, etc. (positives) give further insight. The max words can also be adjusted to generate more similar words. 

![wordcloud1](./screenshots/file5.png)

Querying over “bathroom” with a larger number of “max words” returns a more detailed summary. Again, the possibilities are endless; just keep querying the word cloud generator to get new insights.

### Conclusion:

Through this exploratory data analysis and visualization project, we gained several interesting insights into the Airbnb rental market. Below we will summarise the answers to the questions that we wished to answer at the beginning of the project:

**How do prices of listings vary by location?**
**What localities in NYC are rated highly by guests?**
Manhattan has the most expensive rentals compared to the other boroughs. Prices are higher for rentals closer to city hotspots. Rentals that are rated highly on the location by the host also have higher prices. There are a few outliers in Bronx, Staten Island and Brooklyn that defy the above hypothesis.

**How does the demand for Airbnb rentals fluctuate across the year and over years?**
The demand (assuming that it can be inferred from the number of reviews) shows a seasonal pattern - demand increases from January to October, then drops slightly in November and December. In general, the demand for Airbnb listings has been steadily increasing over the years. 

**Are the demand and prices of the rentals correlated?**
Average prices of the rentals increase across the year, which correlates with demand. However, the prices show a spike in December as opposed to slowing demand in this month, which is counterintuitive.
Prices are higher on average on Fridays and Saturdays, compared to the other days of the week.

**What are the different types of properties in NYC? Do they vary by neighborhood?**
There are more than 20 different types of listings in NYC. The ratio of the type of listings to total numbers varies by borough. Staten Island and Brooklyn tend to have property types that are larger and can accommodate more number of people.

**What makes a host a Super host?**
Ratings and Response rates tend to have a direct correlation with a host being ‘promoted’ to the status of the Super host. However, there are other factors too that makes someone a super host as the not all hosts with high ratings and response rates were superb hosts.

**Do regular hosts and super hosts have different cancellation and booking policies?**
Both have similar cancellation and booking policies.

**Are there any common themes that can be identified from the free-text section of the reviews? What aspects of the rental experience do people like and what aspects do they abhor?**
There are certain words such as words such as "quiet", "walkable", "clean", "spotless" that are associated with the word "comfortable" demonstrating the importance of environment, location and cleanliness. Words associated with “uncomfortable” include "cramped", "crowded","small", "stuffy" 
"cluttered" which indicate that lack of space is one of the most common complaints. 

####Limitations

* We did not have data for past years and hence could not compare current rental trends with past trends. Hence, there was an assumption made, particularly in the demand and supply section of the report to understand the booking trends.

* There was random sampling done while performing the user review analysis due to memory limitations. We assume that our random sample is representative of the whole population.

* There were certain features such as ```acceptance_rate```, ```monthly_price``` and ```description``` that either contained missing values or values in the free-text format that was not easy to work on and hence were dropped from our analysis.

Besides gaining interesting insights into the Airbnb rental market in NYC, we acquired several technical and soft skills along the way. Dealing with multiple data formats helped us strengthen our skills in data manipulation and cleaning. We learned how to work on different R frameworks and libraries, particularly RShiny to create interactive visualization. Working in a team environment gave us an opportunity to collaborate with our classmates, understand different viewpoints and learn from each other. We also learnt how to effectively deploy Github and other version control systems while working on a group project.

#### Future Directions
We want to expand our analysis to multiple cities and compare patterns and trends amongst these cities. From the insights we have derived, we would also like to build predictive models using different features from the dataset. Lastly, we hope to implement the visualizations and techniques used in this project to many other fields and datasets.
